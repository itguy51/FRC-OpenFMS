FRC-OpenFMS
===========

UPDATE: NEWS - I've almost finished refactoring this application into modules that can be included in any project - the new code is going to be up in a few weeks, and one thing to note - The new version is under a BSD license, and as a result may require your application to use a different license. Contact me if you have any licensing questions.


Get the feeling of being at a FRC Competition without the hassle of traveling!

Project Goal

 To bring a current, stable and extensible FMS system to the masses (Such as those that are either running Mac OS or Linux, or those that simply like the concept of being able to see how the Driver Station is interacted with on the competition field.)

Current Features
  * FMS connection recognized by Driver Station
  * 3v3 Team Management

Eventual Features
  * Secondary Display Screen
  * Android App/iPad App to be used as FMS Ref Screens

Explanation of OpenFMS

The idea of OpenFMS is NOT to encourage teams to try to crack/break the real FMS, but more as a tool for them to hold their own mini competitions. It encourages teams to work together to form preliminary ideas for what types of bots help them score the highest. It's also a great way to explain how the real FMS works, so that teams are made aware of how the FMS cannot interfere with communications between the driver station and the robot, as the FMS cannot talk to a team's robot. 


Apologies for not maintaining this project well. I've been extremely busy over the past year or so and just recently finished with the stresses of college applications.
